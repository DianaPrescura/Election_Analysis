# Purpose

## The project oversees an election audit of the results for the US congressional precinct in Colorado. The main tasks of this report are given by the extraction of the total number of the votes on the one hand, and on the other hand the total number of votes for each candidate. Furthermore, it will be reported the percentage of the votes for each candidate, concluding with the county with the highest turnout.

# Election audit results
    * First of all, we have been instructed to find out the total  number of votes which is in our case: 369,711. 
    * The majority county votes were identified in Denver, obtaining 82.8% of the total votes (306,055). On the opposite pole, it would be Arapahoe, with only 24,801 votes, only  6.7% of the total votes. Regarding Jefferson, we could affirm that it was registered 38,855 of votes, the rest of 10.5% of the total votes.
    * Another observation worth pointing out is given by largest county turnout: Denver, with 82.8% of the total votes.
    * Diana DeGette is considered to be the winner, it was given to her a total of 272,892 of votes, being chosen by 73.8% of the voters. The second runner, with a total of 85,213 votes would be Charles Casper Stockham, which represents 23.0% of the total votes. On the third place, with the remaining 3.1% of the votes (11,606) is Raymond Anthony Doane.
    * As a last observation after analysing the data, we can affirm that the winner of this election is Diana DeGette, with the wining voting count: 272,892, representing 73.8% of the votes.
# Election audit summary
    Summarising this report, the election commission could be notified that the script it has been used could be used for any election with some modification. One suggestion would be that the election audit could be done in other senatorial districts, and also local elections. A second would be given by the name of candidates.
